# JavaScript Basics in Express

## Getting started

Ensure your Visual Studio Code application is up to date, and that you have the [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) installed and enabled.


```bash
git clone git@github.com:SanMasood/javascript-basics-express.git
cd your-project-folder-name
npm install
```

Assuming you already have Node.js, you will also need express.js to run this application.
```bash
npm install express --save
```
## JavaScript Basics code


This exercise makes use of `javascript-basics` code. 
You will find the code for this here: https://github.com/SanMasood/javascript-basics

Copy the files from that project's `src/` folder into a new `lib/` directory in this repository's `src` directory. You should end up with the following file structure:

```
src
├── app.js
└── lib
    ├── arrays.js
    ├── booleans.js
    ├── numbers.js
    ├── objects.js
    └── strings.js
```

## Running tests

You can run tests with the `npm test` command.
