# JavaScript Basics in Express

## Getting started

Ensure your Visual Studio Code application is up to date, and that you have the [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) installed and enabled.

Run the commands below inside your `Projects` folder.

If you have set up an SSH key in your Github Account then feel free to clone this repo using SSH as follows:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:CommandShiftHQ/javascript-basics-express.git
```

Otherwise clone is as you normally would by URL with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CommandShiftHQ/javascript-basics-express
```

Once cloned ensure you install its dependencies:
```bash
cd javascript-basics-express
```
```bash
npm install
```

## Copy over your JavaScript Basics code

:rotating_light: **Important!**

This exercise makes use of your previous `javascript-basics` code. Copy the files from that project's `src/` folder into a new `lib/` directory in this repository's `src` directory. You should end up with the following file structure in this project:

```
src
├── app.js
└── lib
    ├── arrays.js
    ├── booleans.js
    ├── numbers.js
    ├── objects.js
    └── strings.js
```

## Running tests

You can run tests with the `npm test` command.

## Remember: READMEs are important!

When you're finished, be sure to rewrite this one so it's more specific to your project.
